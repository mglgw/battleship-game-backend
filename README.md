# Simple battleship game - 1v1 multiplayer

## Introduction
I made this simple classic turn based battleship game with a goal to get to know SignalR. Right now based on my newer [QuizGame](https://github.com/mglgw/QuizGame) project I see some potential for upgrades here and there, mostly on fronend side.
